# Bands on the Modulation tab: band-limiting the blobs

An addition to the Modulation tab (`blobs.md`). Today the carrier fills
every band from 100 to 6400 Hz, so wherever a blob sits on the plane, the
sound covers the whole spectrogram. Cho asked (2026-10-05) for a way to
band-limit it, perhaps as drawn tracks: a time-varying filter like a
formant, with up to about five bands. This note designs that.

Status: decided (2026-10-05). Cho accepted every recommendation (K1–K7),
and, for K7, chose that the measured modulation spectrum be analysed within
the bands. Built: steps 1 and 2 of the order of work, and the measured
plane (`blobs.md`, B7) with K7's analysis within the bands (K-M4).

This project is AI-assisted: the document and `tools/measure_bands.py`
were drafted by Claude (Claude Code), for Cho to review.

## Why

A modulation spectrum says how the envelopes move, not where in frequency
they are. Real sounds put their modulation in places: a vowel's syllable
rhythm rides on its formants, a bird's trill sits in one octave. With
bands, a drawing can say both: "4 Hz flutter, but only around 500 Hz and
2 kHz, and the upper band rising". It also makes the lessons sharper: a
blob at 1 cyc/oct heard in a 2-octave band is two ripples sweeping
through a window, not a sheet across the whole range.

## How the claims are verified

As in `blobs.md`: **[measure]** is printed by `tools/measure_bands.py`
(sonore 0.5.0 natively, 16 kHz, 100–6400 Hz, 12 bands per octave, the two
starting blobs, rng 1, on a 4-core Linux cloud container, so not an
independent check); **[read]** is read from sonore's source;
**[estimate]** gives its basis.

## What a band is

A **band** is a centre-frequency track (breakpoints in time, as on the
Speech tab, interpolated in log frequency and held past the ends), a
width in octaves and a level in dB. Its gain is 1 (times its level)
within half the width of the centre, falls along a raised-cosine skirt of
1/6 octave on each side, and reaches a floor of −60 dB. Several bands
combine by taking the largest gain at each time and frequency. With no
bands the tab sounds as it does now.

## Three ways to put the gain on the sound

- **envelopes**: multiply each carrier band's envelope by the gain at its
  centre, before the fine structure goes under it. Exact, but it means
  writing out `to_sound`'s tones and noise routes in the page's Python
  (`to_sound` takes no gain), and iterations would pull the result back
  toward the unbanded target, since they re-impose the stored magnitudes
  [read: `ModulationSpectrum.to_sound`].
- **subbands**: synthesize as now, analyse the result with the same cosine
  filterbank, multiply by a `so.Mask`, resynthesize.
- **stft**: the same with a 20 ms `so.STFT` and a gain per bin.

The last two are a time-varying filter after synthesis; they work on any
carrier, after iterations, and would work on a recording (the parked
Filter recording tab, `mask.md`) without change. `so.Mask` already does
the multiplying [read: `sonore/views/mask.py`].

## Measurements

**K-M1. All three routes reject about the same: 45–58 dB.** [measure]
Long-term level inside a static band at 1 kHz over the level half an
octave or more outside it, 3 s:

| Band | Carrier | envelopes | subbands | stft |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2 oct | tones | 52.7 dB | 54.4 dB | 53.7 dB |
| 2 oct | harmonic | 45.8 dB | 44.9 dB | 44.9 dB |
| 2 oct | noise | 57.8 dB | 57.7 dB | 57.4 dB |
| 1 oct | tones | 53.7 dB | 51.4 dB | 51.2 dB |
| 1/3 oct | tones | 53.5 dB | 54.3 dB | 54.1 dB |

The floor of −60 dB sets the limit; the routes differ by about 2 dB.

**K-M2. Static bands keep the blobs; a moving band adds modulation of its
own.** [measure] The B-M4 contrast of `blobs.md` (measured power where
the drawing is within 6 dB of its peak over where it is 30 dB or more
below), leaving out |rate| < 1 Hz, where a band's own spectral shape
lands; tones, 3 s. "Band only" analyses just the band's own range.

| Case | whole range | band only |
|---|---|---|
| no band | 26.1 dB | |
| 2 oct at 1 kHz | 27.0 dB | 23.6 dB |
| 1 oct at 1 kHz | 24.0 dB | 21.5 dB |
| two 1/2-oct bands, 500 Hz and 2 kHz | 19.8 dB | |
| 1 oct gliding 500 → 4000 Hz (1 oct/s) | 10.0 dB | |

The envelopes and subbands routes give the same numbers to 0.1 dB. A
static band costs a few dB: a narrower band holds fewer carrier bands, so
the density axis is resolved more coarsely (a band *w* octaves wide
resolves density in steps of about 1/*w* cyc/oct [estimate: the width of
the analysis window in octaves]). A glide is a sweep, and a sweep is
modulation at low rate and some density, so the measured plane shows the
glide as well as the blobs. That is what the drawing asks for, not a
fault, but the hint under the plane should say so (K7).

**K-M3. The STFT route is nearly free.** [measure] Tones, one 1-octave
band, warm median of three:

| | 3 s | 10 s |
|---|---|---|
| plain synthesis | 0.24 s | 1.50 s |
| envelopes route (synthesis included) | 0.25 s | 1.62 s |
| subbands route (added to synthesis) | 0.55 s | 1.97 s |
| stft route (added to synthesis) | 0.03 s | 0.09 s |

**K-M4. Measured within the bands, a moving band no longer hides the
blobs.** [measure] The same contrast on the result's measured plane, tones,
3 s, analysed over the whole range or within the bands
(`sonore_sketch.blobs.measured`: each band's envelope divided by the gain
the bands gave it, relative to its mean, weighted by that gain):

| Band | whole range | within the bands |
|---|---|---|
| 1 oct at 1 kHz | 24.8 dB | 24.8 dB |
| 1 oct gliding 500 → 4000 Hz | 10.5 dB | 22.5 dB |
| 2 oct gliding 300 → 2400 Hz | 14.1 dB | 20.8 dB |

A static band changes nothing away from rate 0; a moving band's sweep
drops out, leaving the blobs blurred by the band's extent.

## Proposed design

```

- The bands are drawn on the spectrogram panel already under the plane
  (time × log frequency, 100–6400 Hz), each as its centre line with
  breakpoint circles and a translucent strip one width wide, so the
  drawing sits on what came out.
- Gestures follow the Speech tab: drag a circle to move it, click on a
  band's line to add a breakpoint, Delete removes the selected
  breakpoint (or the band, with the band selected and no point). "Add
  band" places a flat band, one octave wide, at a free frequency.
- The side panel edits the selected band's width and level. Up to five
  bands.

### Data model

An optional list in the `blobs` section; old links have none and sound as
before, so the section's format number stays 1:

```json
"bands": [
  {"points": [[0, 500], [0.6, 500]], "width": 1, "level": 0},
  {"points": [[0, 2000], [0.3, 2600], [0.6, 2000]], "width": 0.5, "level": -6}
]
```

Times stretch with the page's duration, as the Speech tab's tracks do.

### Python side

`blobs.synthesize` applies the bands last, after the carrier and any
iterations, through `so.STFT` and `so.Mask`, then normalizes to RMS 1 as
now. The gain function and the track interpolation live in `blobs.py`, so no
new module needs adding to the worker's `PYTHON_FILES`. The page draws the strips from the same formula
in JavaScript. Tests: rejection of a static band (K-M1, as a test), no
bands gives today's samples exactly, a saved state gives the same samples
in Python and from the page.

## Decisions

**K1. Where the gain goes.**
(a) a time-varying filter after synthesis, on a 20 ms STFT;
(b) the same on the cosine filterbank's subbands;
(c) on the envelopes before the carrier.
*Recommended:* (a). K-M1 and K-M2 show the three give the same sound to
within about 2 dB; (a) costs almost nothing (K-M3), works with every
carrier and with iterations, and would carry over to recordings. Its
50 Hz bins are coarse only below about 300 Hz, where a 1/3-octave band
spans two or three bins [estimate: bin spacing over band width].

**K2. A band's shape.**
(a) a flat top with 1/6-octave raised-cosine skirts and a −60 dB floor;
(b) a formant resonance (as Klatt's, with its bandwidth in Hz), which
never silences what lies outside;
(c) a Gaussian in log frequency.
*Recommended:* (a), since the ask is to confine the sound: (b) leaves the
whole range audible a few tens of dB down. A formant-like look comes from
the drawing (moving centres, levels), not from the skirts.

**K3. Width.**
(a) one width per band, 1/6 to 4 octaves, default 1;
(b) a width track as well as a centre track.
*Recommended:* (a) for now; (b) doubles the drawing for little gain, and
a band whose width should change can be split into two.

**K4. Level per band.**
(a) a level in dB per band, −40 to 0, constant over time;
(b) none: every band at 0 dB.
*Recommended:* (a): formants differ in strength, and it is one field.

**K5. How bands combine.**
(a) the largest gain; (b) the sum of their powers.
*Recommended:* (a): two overlapping bands then make one wider band
rather than a 3 dB bump where they cross.

**K6. Where they are drawn.**
(a) on the spectrogram panel under the plane, as sketched;
(b) on a panel of their own.
*Recommended:* (a): the drawing lies on its result, and the tab keeps one
time × frequency view.

**K7. What the measured result shows.**
With bands drawn, a one-line hint says that moving bands add modulation
of their own (K-M2).
*Recommended:* as stated.

*Added (2026-10-05, Cho):* a band confined in time and frequency cannot
leave the whole sound's modulation spectrum as drawn (a moving band is
itself a sweep), so the blobs are read as the modulation *inside* the
bands, and the bands' motion as a layer of its own, as formants carry a
syllable rhythm. When the measured modulation spectrum is built (B7), it
is analysed within the bands, following them, so it shows what the blobs
drew. Searching for a sound that meets both whole-sound constraints at
once (alternating between the bands and the blobs, as Griffin & Lim do)
was considered and not chosen: it can only partly cancel a band's motion.

## Going back and forth (added 2026-10-05)

Cho asked whether the blobs and the bands could constrain each other in a
loop. With bands drawn, the Iterations setting now does that: impose the
blobs on the sound's envelopes *relative to the bands' gain* (as
`measured` reads them, so the bands' motion is not what the blobs fight),
give the gain back, put the bands on again, and repeat
(`sonore_sketch.blobs._toward_blobs`). Without bands, iterations are
`to_sound`'s, as before; the harmonic carrier takes them only with bands
(K-M5b, below).

**K-M5. The loop gets back most of what the bands cost.** [measure]
`tools/measure_loop.py`: the B-M4 contrast within the bands, 3 s, the
starting drawing, at 0 and 10 iterations. "now" is iterations on the whole
range, then the bands; "naive" alternates without dividing out the gain;
"within" is what the tab does.

| Band | carrier | 0 | now 10 | naive 10 | within 10 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| none | tones | 26.1 | 35.0 | | |
| 1 oct at 1 kHz | tones | 24.8 | 25.3 | 31.5 | 30.4 |
| 1 oct gliding 500→4000 Hz | tones | 22.5 | 23.0 | 27.3 | 26.9 |
| 2 oct gliding 300→2400 Hz | tones | 20.8 | 21.0 | 23.3 | 28.3 |
| 1/2 oct at 500 Hz and 2 kHz | tones | 20.7 | 21.0 | 25.1 | 23.7 |
| 1 oct at 1 kHz | noise | 13.7 | 21.2 | 29.6 | 28.7 |
| 1 oct gliding 500→4000 Hz | noise | 14.9 | 20.1 | 23.9 | 27.0 |

After 10 iterations a static 1-octave band rejects 62.5 dB now, 44.4 dB
naive and 74.2 dB within: the naive loop lets the band leak, which is why
it was not chosen. An iteration costs about what one of `to_sound`'s does
(1.2 s against 1.05 s at 3 s in the cloud container).

**K-M5a. It levels off, at a ceiling set by the bands' width.** [measure]
The same contrast run to 50 rounds (the loop of `blobs._toward_blobs`;
columns are rounds 0, 10, 20, 50):

| Band | tones | noise |
|---|---|---|
| none (`to_sound`'s iterations) | 26.1, 35.0, 36.7, 38.9 | 14.7, 23.7, 25.5, 27.3 |
| 1 oct at 1 kHz | 24.8, 30.4, 30.7, 30.7 | 13.7, 28.7, 29.5, 30.2 |
| 1 oct gliding 500→4000 Hz | 22.5, 26.9, 27.5, 27.9 | 14.9, 27.0, 27.7, 28.2 |
| 2 oct gliding 300→2400 Hz | 20.8, 28.3, 29.1, 29.7 | 12.8, 27.4, 28.6, 29.6 |
| 1/2 oct at 500 Hz and 2 kHz | 20.7, 23.7, 23.8, 23.9 | 11.4, 22.6, 23.0, 23.4 |

No case went backwards. With bands, 10 rounds give 85–95% of what 50
do, and the level reached falls with the bands' width (about 24 dB for
half-octave bands, 28–31 dB for one or two octaves), as a band *w* octaves
wide resolves density only in steps of about 1/*w* cyc/oct (K-M2).
Without bands the search keeps climbing slowly.

**K-M5b. On the harmonic carrier, iterations help only with bands.**
[measure] The same contrast, harmonic carrier on 100 Hz, B9's blobs, 3 s,
at 0, 1, 2, 5 and 10 iterations: with no bands (`to_sound`'s step on the
harmonic fine structure) 23.0, 15.9, 17.1, 19.6, 21.9 dB, worse than none;
with a 1-octave band gliding 500→4000 Hz (the loop) 18.8, 22.7, 23.9,
26.0, 26.8 dB. Several harmonics share each carrier band and beat at F0,
and without bands that beating keeps pulling the modulation phase away
[inferred]. So the page offers Iterations on the harmonic carrier only when
bands are drawn (Cho, 2026-10-06).

**K-M6. Which dominates the whole sound: the blobs, unless the bands move
fast or the blobs are shallow.** [measure] `tools/measure_dominance.py`:
the blobs' share of the result's modulation power over the whole range,
|rate| 1–64 Hz, tones, 3 s (the bands-alone power over the result's,
taken as the bands' share; a fit of blobs alone plus bands alone agrees
within about 10 points):

| Band | depth 0.2 | 0.2, 10 iterations | depth 0.05 |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 oct static | 100% | 100% | 100% |
| 1 oct gliding 1/3 oct/s | 89% | 98% | 33% |
| 1 oct gliding 1 oct/s | 44% | 80% | 5% |
| 2 oct gliding 1 oct/s | 60% | 84% | 9% |
| 1/2 oct up and down 2 oct/s | 4% | 43% | 0% |

A static band's shape lands at rate 0, which the plane leaves out.

## Order of work

1. Python: the gain, `synthesize` with bands, tests (rejection, no bands
   unchanged).
2. The page: bands on the spectrogram panel, gestures, side panel, the
   page's own gain for the strips, the page check adding a band and
   hearing it. The Edit modulation work in the Handoff doc thread touches
   `app/blobs/`; this step goes after it lands, or is rebased onto it.
