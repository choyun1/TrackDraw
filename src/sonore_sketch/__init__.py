"""sonore-sketch: draw on a picture of sound and hear the result.

Each tab of the page is one of sonore's routes back to sound. This package is
the Python half: one function per tab that turns the tab's state into a
``sonore.Sound``, run by the page under Pyodide and usable in a notebook, so a
saved drawing gives the same sound in both.
