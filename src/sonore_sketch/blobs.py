"""The Draw modulation tab's state, and the sound it describes.

A drawing is a list of Gaussian blobs on a modulation spectrum, rate [Hz,
signed] by density [cycles/octave] (docs/design/tabs/blobs.md)::

    {"blobs": 1, "sonore": "0.5.0", "duration": 3.0, "fs": 16000,
     "f_lo": 100, "f_hi": 6400, "bands_per_octave": 12,
     "carrier": "tones", "f0": 100, "iterations": 0, "rms_depth": 0.2, "seed": 1,
     "items": [{"rate": 4, "density": 0, "rate_width": 0.5,
                "density_width": 0.25, "level": 0}, ...],
     "bands": [{"points": [[0, 500], [3, 500]], "width": 1, "level": 0}, ...]}

Each item is a ``so.ModulationBlob``; the sound is
``so.ModulationSpectrum.from_blobs(...).to_sound(...)``, RMS 1. The seed
draws the modulation phase (and the noise carrier), so a drawing always
gives the same samples. The harmonic carrier is a harmonic complex on
``f0`` whose band-by-band fine structure carries the drawn envelopes, as
``to_sound`` does for a recording but with the modulation phase drawn from
the seed.

``bands`` (optional, docs/design/tabs/bands.md) confine the sound to drawn
regions of the spectrogram: each is a centre-frequency track, a width in
octaves and a level, applied last as a time-varying filter on a 20 ms STFT
(``so.Mask``). With no bands the sound is the whole range, as before.
With bands, ``iterations`` go back and forth between the two: impose the
blobs on the sound inside the bands, put the bands on again, and repeat,
so each constrains the other (``_toward_blobs``; tools/measure_loop.py).
