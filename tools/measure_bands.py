"""Measure band-limiting the Modulation tab's sound (docs/design/tabs/bands.md).

This script runs sonore to measure it; it is not an independent check. A
band is a centre-frequency track (breakpoints in time) and a width in
octaves; its gain is 1 within half the width of the centre, falls along a
raised-cosine skirt and reaches a floor of -60 dB. Several bands combine by
taking the largest gain. Three routes put the gain on the sound:

* ``envelopes``: multiply each carrier band's envelope by the gain at its
  centre before the carrier goes under it (the tones route of
  ``ModulationSpectrum.to_sound``, written out here);
* ``subbands``: synthesize as now, analyse the result with the same cosine
  filterbank, and apply a ``so.Mask`` to the subbands;
* ``stft``: the same with a 20 ms STFT and a gain per bin.

The script prints:

1. Rejection: the result's long-term level inside a static band over the
   level more than half an octave outside it, per route and carrier.
2. Whether the blobs survive: the B-M4 contrast of blobs.md (drawn peak over
   the rest), leaving out |rate| < 1 Hz, measured over the whole range and
   over the band's own range, for no band, static bands of 2 and 1 octaves,
   and a band gliding 1 octave per second.
3. Speed: plain synthesis, the envelopes route (synthesis included) and
   what the subbands and stft routes add, at 3 and 10 s.
4. The measured plane analysed within the bands, against the whole range.
