"""Measure how long the candidate tabs' sonore calls take, natively.

This script runs sonore to measure it; it is not an independent check. It
times the synthesis behind three of the tabs proposed in
docs/design/app.md, at 16 kHz, for 1 s, 3 s and 10 s of sound: the first call
(cold) and the median of the next three (warm).

- Modulation blobs: ``so.ModulationSpectrum.from_blobs`` then
  ``.to_sound(carrier=...)`` on tones and on noise. These are on sonore's
  main branch after 0.4.0 and not yet released; the script reports the
  installed sonore and skips them if they are missing.
- Painted envelope: ``so.ripple_sound`` with a pattern function, as a
  painted time x log-frequency grid would be.
- Spectrogram mask: ``so.GaborFrame`` analysis of a noise, half its
  coefficients zeroed, least-squares synthesis.
