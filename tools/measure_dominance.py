"""Measure which dominates the Modulation tab's result: the blobs or the bands.

This script runs sonore to measure it; it is not an independent check. With
bands drawn, the result's modulation spectrum over the whole range holds
two things: the blobs' modulation, and the modulation the bands add by
their own shape and motion (a moving band is a sweep; bands.md, K-M2). To
split them, the script synthesizes each alone, on the same tones carrier
and seed:

* blobs alone: the drawing with no bands;
* bands alone: the bands on an all-but-unmodulated sound (the drawing at
  ``rms_depth`` 1e-4, tones), so only the bands' gain moves the envelopes;

and fits the result's measured power as ``a * blobs + b * bands`` (non-
negative least squares, cell by cell, over the plane the tab shows:
|rate| from 1 to 64 Hz, density up to 6 cyc/oct). The blobs' share is
``a * sum(blobs) / (a * sum(blobs) + b * sum(bands))``; the fit's residual
says how well the two parts explain the result. A band also blurs the
blobs along density (fewer carrier bands, K-M2), which the fit cannot
express, so its residual is large for static bands. The plainer
measure is first: the bands-alone power over the result's power is the
bands' share (both are RMS 1 through the same bands, so their envelope
means match), and the rest is the blobs'. Rate 0 is left out: a
band's static shape lands there (the long-term spectrum), which the plane
does not show.

It prints the share per band case, for the drawing the tab starts with at
its default depth (0.2) and at a shallow one (0.05), and for the result as
the tab makes it now (bands last) and after 10 iterations of the
``within`` loop (tools/measure_loop.py).
