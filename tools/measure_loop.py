"""Measure going back and forth between the blobs and the bands.

This script runs sonore to measure it; it is not an independent check. The
Modulation tab applies the bands last, as a time-varying filter on the
finished sound (docs/design/tabs/bands.md, K1), so the bands always hold and
the blobs pay: the measured plane within the bands (``blobs.measured``) is
a few dB less like the drawing than with no bands (K-M2, K-M4). The
question is whether alternating between the two constraints, as Griffin &
Lim do, gets some of that back. Three ways to spend ``n`` iterations:

* ``after``: what the tab does now, ``to_sound(iterations=n)`` on the whole
  range, then the bands once;
* ``naive``: the bands, then ``n`` times: one of ``to_sound``'s iterations
  on the whole range (keep the fine structure and modulation phase,
  impose the drawn magnitudes), then the bands again;
* ``within``: the bands, then ``n`` times: the same step taken on the
  envelopes *relative to the bands' gain* (as ``blobs.measured`` reads
  them), multiplied by the gain again, then the bands again. The band's own
  shape and motion stay out of what the blobs are imposed on.

The script prints, per band case and iteration count:

1. The B-M4 contrast of blobs.md on the measured plane within the bands
   (measured power where the drawing is within 6 dB of its peak over where
   it is 30 dB or more below, |rate| from 1 to 32 Hz, density <= 4), tones
   and noise, 3 s, the drawing the tab starts with.
2. Rejection: level inside the band over the level half an octave or more
   outside it (static band only), so the bands still hold.
3. Time per iteration, warm.
