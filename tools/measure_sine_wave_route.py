"""Measure whether sonore's harmonic_complex can make sine-wave speech.

This script runs sonore 0.4.0 to measure what it does; it is not an
independent check. The reference it compares against is written out here
from the formula, with NumPy only.

Sine-wave speech (Remez, Rubin, Pisoni & Carrell, 1981), as Track-Draw's
SWSYNTH made it (Assmann et al., 1994, Equations 2 and 3): one sinusoid per
formant track, x(i) = sum_k a_k(i) cos(theta_k(i)), with the phase
accumulated sample by sample, theta_k(i) = theta_k(i-1) + 2 pi F_k(i) T. A
frame below 30 Hz drops that tone. The question is whether
``so.harmonic_complex(duration, fs, (times, F_k), harmonics=[1])`` is that
sinusoid, and what it does differently. Each line prints a measurement
number (M1-M5, as in docs/design/tabs/tracks.md) and the value.
